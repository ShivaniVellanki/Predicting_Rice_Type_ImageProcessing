# Predicting_Rice_Type_ImageProcessing
A project using Big Data and AI to classify rice images into varieties using Hadoop and PySpark for processing and CNNs for training. 


The project is centered around utilizing the Big Data framework to address the challenge of image classification, specifically focusing on categorizing rice images into distinct varieties. The cornerstone of the project is the Rice dataset, which encompasses 5 categories, each with approximately 15,000 sample images. The dataset is enriched with 12 morphological, 4 shape, and 90 color features, targeting varieties such as Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag. The Hadoop ecosystem, particularly leveraging the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for data storage and PySpark for data processing, serves as the technical backbone. The integration of PySpark, a Spark extension supporting Python, enables the efficient processing of images and subsequent storage of results. The project adopts Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for training the data, emphasizing the necessity of aligning the versions of Hadoop, Spark, Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to ensure compatibility and seamless functionality.

The aim of the project is to harness the potent capabilities of the Hadoop ecosystem, specifically the symbiotic relationship between HDFS and PySpark, to facilitate the large-scale processing of image data. This approach enables the development of a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solution for the classification of rice images. Through meticulous data preprocessing, including resizing and normalization, followed by the construction and fine-tuning of a CNN model, the project seeks to achieve high accuracy in categorizing rice types. The output of the project is a well-trained model capable of distinguishing among various rice varieties with commendable precision, thereby demonstrating the viability of combining Big Data frameworks with deep learning techniques for sophisticated image classification tasks. It emphasizes its potential for deployment in real-world applications, making a significant contribution to the domain of agricultural product classification and beyond.
